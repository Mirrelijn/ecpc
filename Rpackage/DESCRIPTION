Description: This package fits linear, logistic and Cox survival regression models penalised with adaptive multi-group ridge penalties.
  The multi-group penalties correspond to groups of covariates defined by (multiple) co-data sources. 
  Group hyperparameters are estimated with an empirical Bayes method of moments, penalised with an extra level of hypershrinkage.
  Various types of hypershrinkage may be used for various co-data.
  The method accomodates inclusion of unpenalised covariates, posterior selection of covariates and multiple datatypes.
  The model fit is used to predict for new samples.
