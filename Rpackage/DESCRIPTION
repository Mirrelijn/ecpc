Description: Fit linear, logistic and Cox survival regression models penalised with adaptive multi-group ridge penalties.
  The multi-group penalties correspond to groups of covariates defined by (multiple) co-data sources. 
  Group hyperparameters are estimated with an empirical Bayes method of moments, penalised with an extra level of hypershrinkage.
  Various types of hypershrinkage may be used for various co-data.
  The method accommodates inclusion of unpenalised covariates, posterior selection of covariates and multiple data types.
  The model fit is used to predict for new samples.
  The name ecpc stands for Empirical bayes Co-data learnt Prediction and Covariate selection.
