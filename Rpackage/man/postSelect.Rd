}
  \item{sigmahat}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{sigmahat} here~~

(optional) Independent observed data.
}
  \item{Y2}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Y2} here~~

A list with the following elements:

  'betaPost' is a matrix with each column the vector estimate corresponding to the maximum number of 
  selected covariates given in 'maxsel'.}
