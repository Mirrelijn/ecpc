%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Create a co-data matrix Z for a group set as obtained for instance with \link{createGroupset}.

\arguments{
  \item{groupset}{
  A list with G elements that contain the indices of the variables belonging to each of the groups.
}
\item{p}{
Number of covariates in total. If not given, taken as maximum index in `groupset'. But in cases where some covariates are left unpenalised, the total number of covariates may be larger.
}
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
A (pxG)-dimensional co-data matrix.
